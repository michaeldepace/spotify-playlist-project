# spotify-playlist-project

takes public rap playist data from spotify and uses it to cluster songs together into playlists

final project:
website that builds playlists for you based on public playlist data
have it randomly generate playlists for you based on a master list of rap songs collected from playlists
maybe build a network graph of all songs we've collected and how they are connected to one another in frequency
